## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Engineer | Red/Blue Team | SOC & Pentesting | AI for Security | Building real-world labs, GenAI agents & secure systems.


I'm a driven and curious **Cybersecurity Engineer** with a strong focus on real-world problem solving. My work revolves around **SOC operations**, **penetration testing**, **malware analysis**, and simulating both **Red and Blue Team strategies** using hands-on labs, CTFs, and open-source tooling.

Alongside my passion for security, I also explore the power of **Artificial Intelligence** — developing small-scale tools for **threat detection**, **phishing classification**, and experimenting with **Generative AI agents** that automate security workflows.

To round out my skillset, I also build clean, responsive **web interfaces** using WordPress and frontend tools like HTML, Tailwind, and Bootstrap, with a strong focus on user experience.

This portfolio is a collection of everything I’m learning, building, and sharing — one project at a time. Whether it's a Python tool, an AI prototype, or a CTF writeup, each project reflects my dedication to becoming a well-rounded, modern engineer.

> 💡 I don’t just learn for certifications — I learn to solve problems, break things, rebuild, and grow.

## 🧠 My Focus Areas

### 🛡️ **Cybersecurity Engineering (Main Domain)**

I’ve been actively building skills in various areas of cybersecurity through labs, CTFs, and simulations. My main focus includes:

- **SOC Analyst Practices** – Log analysis, SIEM basics, threat intelligence  
- **Pentesting & Vulnerability Scanning** – Tools like Nmap, Burp Suite, Hydra, Nikto  
- **Red Teaming** – CTFs, exploitation & enumeration (VulnHub, TryHackMe)  
- **Blue Teaming** – Log monitoring, Linux hardening, firewall configuration  
- **Malware Analysis (Basic)** – Using Ghidra, VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis  

---

### 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence for Security & Automation**

Exploring how AI improves security by detecting threats and automating analysis:

- **AI-Powered Threat Detection** – Phishing classifiers, anomaly detection in logs  
- **Generative AI Projects** – Simple agents, chatbots, and prompt engineering  
- **ML Stack** – Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks  

---

### 🌐 **Web Development & UI/UX Design**

In addition to cybersecurity and AI, I also explore creative web and frontend work:

- **WordPress Development** – Building websites and landing pages  
- **Frontend Stack** – HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, JavaScript  
- **UI/UX Design** – Creating wireframes and mockups using Figma
